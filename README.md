This WIP software leverages the Papajohn's UK iPhone API to order pizza.

At the moment, it only accepts your postcode, offers you local restaurants with delivery in the proximity and then presents 
you with a list of the deals they have on offer.  

Logic exists to handle the flow of the deals, e.g. selecting your pizza, toppings, sides, dips, etc..

To do: implement account login so you get your loyalty points, and redirecting for payment (probably use web browser for this)
